        <p class="text-justify">Students, Monitors, Teachers and Staff are expected to follow the LDSA Honor Code, in letter and in spirit.</p>
        <h3>
        <a id="user-content-application-to-the-academy" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Application to the Academy</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">Your application to the Academy must consist entirely of your own work, done without assistance from more experienced programmers. Cheating on any stage of the Academy is a grave infringement of the Code of Conduct. It is especially serious on the application tests, as cheating means excluding another student who would want to participate.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Students found (even retroactively) to have cheated on the application tests will be expelled, with no right to refund or redress. The test exists to make sure you have the skills to fully enjoy the Academy, so cheating is counter-productive for everyone.</p>
        <h3>
        <a id="user-content-academic-integrity-on-all-assignments-and-exercises" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Academic integrity on all assignments and exercises</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">Your answers to assignments must be your own work (except for assignments that explicitly permit collaboration).</p>
        <p class="text-justify">You may not share your assignment solutions with anyone else unless explicitly permitted by the instructor. This includes anything written by you, as well as any official solutions provided by the course staff.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">You may not engage in any other activities that will dishonestly improve your results or dishonestly improve or damage the results of others. Plagiarism may result in permanent exclusion from the Academy.</p>
        <h3>
        <a id="user-content-hints-not-answers" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Hints, not answers!</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">When students are stuck on an assignment, they can (and should!) reach out to other students and mentors for help. The code of conduct is to answer such requests with hints. These can be, for instance, a link to some documentation, or a reference of what the logic should be, and (if nothing else works) pseudo code with the sequence to follow.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Please <strong>do not share the code solutions</strong> with fellow students or anywhere online, as it is important that they manage to get the answers themselves so that the logic "sinks in" on their own merits.</p class="text-justify">
        <p class="text-justify">Having answers posted on slack channels, GitHub issues etc makes the temptation to look up the answer too great. Posting code answers online will be considered a breach of the code of conduct that will result in a warning.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Repeated and intentional postings of answers can result in eventual suspension of the offending student, mentor or instructor. When in doubt, ask a mentor for advice on whether something is a hint or if infringes the code of conduct.</p>
        <h3>
        <a id="user-content-plagiarism" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Plagiarism</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">Plagiarism is when you copy words, ideas, or any other materials from another source without giving credit. Plagiarism is unacceptable in any academic environment and is a serious violation of the Academy's Honor Code.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Plagiarism and cheating is taken extremely seriously by the staff. Engagement in any of these activities will lead to permanent exclusion from the Academy, with no right to redress or refunds. If you earned an Academy Graduation Certificate, it may be taken away. Students who have previously been banned will be denied access to future editions of the Academy.</p>
        <h3>
        <a id="user-content-discrimination-and-harassment" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Discrimination and Harassment</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">The Lisbon Data Science Academy is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment by participants or staff in any form.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for the Academy.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Attendees violating these rules may be excluded from the Academy without a refund at the sole discretion of the organizers.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>
        <h3>
        <a id="user-content-environmental-policy" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Environmental policy</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">The Academy is, as part of its principles, a zero-plastic and environmentally friendly organisation. That is why you will find senior data scientists serving you expressos to avoid using capsules. As a student you will be expected to follow the same high environmental standards, which are tighter than those demanded by law. That means, among other things, that you will be asked not to bring discardable plastics (e.g. PET bottles) into the Academy lectures, and will be expected to (whenever possible) recycle your waste. Also, if you find ways that we can do better, you are more than encouraged to let us know!</p>
        <h3>
        <a id="user-content-respectful-and-professional-conduct" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Respectful and Professional Conduct</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">The academy is a community of professionals and every single member is expected to behave like one. To be professional means that everyone is treated with respect in both letter and spirit. This is especially important during stressful or difficult times in order to prevent disagreements from descending into anything resembling insulting or personal. To be professional means:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p class="text-justify"><em>Be objective.</em> Not liking something is not a reason to request an adjustment or any other kind of change. Usually when you don't like something it is because, somewhere at it's core, it is unfair. If it is actually unfair, you can usually find a nice and clean way to explain why it is unfair and this is what should be done without exceptions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p class="text-justify"><em>Be respectulf.</em> Personal insults or emotion-driven accusations do nothing to help resolve conflicts. It's amazing how much of a difference it makes to say something like "I'm not sure if this is being done the best way possible, can we talk about it?" rather than "This is so stupid and messed up!".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p class="text-justify"><em>Be constructive.</em> It's incredibly easy to find problems. It's much more difficult to suggest solutions but this is where progress comes from. Saying something like "I think that there's an issue with <code>X</code> and there's a potential solution in <code>Y</code> - what does everyone think?" rather than "<code>X</code> is stupid".</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-justify">Repeated violations of these guidelines are grounds for dismissal from the academy without refund. More important than any amount of technical ability is being respectful and professional toward your fellow human beings.</p>
